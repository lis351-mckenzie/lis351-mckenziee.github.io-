		<p style="color:black;font-family:verdana;font-size:50%">Inspired by the environment and the combination of my creative skills, I am driven to explore sustainable design. As I begin my career as a designer, I am excited to be part of a team where I can bring my skills and create a difference while learning from others. Not only passionate about where design can take us
		but also the storytelling through the journey of design. Research and exploration were used to enhance my design knowledge to benefit project collaboration within
		a team. As my life is filled with design through my major in Interior Architecture and my minor in Digital Studies, understanding the conceptional design to express
		emotions is a goal of mine.  As a designer, I am captivated by the power of design on someone's life in a social, economic, cultural, and political way to enhance the 
		internal environment </p>
